I am a graduate student in Applied Data Analytics at Boston University. My academic and professional interests include financial analytics, machine learning, and real estate modeling. I am particularly interested in careers in data analytics and fixed income research, where I can apply quantitative skills to support investment decisions. My goal is to begin my career as a financial/data analyst in the Boston area and eventually transition into asset management with a focus on fixed income research.

I am a graduate student in Insurance Management at Boston University with a career focused entirely on the corporate property segment of the insurance industry. Iâ€™m pursuing this degree to broaden my skill set, particularly in analytics, and to develop the capabilities needed to contribute to the digital transformation initiatives shaping the future of the industry.

## Fuhan Zhang
I am a graduate student in Applied Business Analytics at Boston University. My academic and professional interests include data analytics, risk management, insurance, and market analysis. With an undergraduate background in actuarial science, I aim to integrate analytical and quantitative skills into the insurance and data analytics industries. My goal is to secure an internship or entry-level position next semester that bridges these two fields, ultimately pursuing a career where data-driven insights enhance actuarial and risk management practices.
