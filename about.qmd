## Yibei Yu
I am a graduate student in Applied Data Analytics at Boston University. My academic and professional interests include financial analytics, machine learning, and real estate modeling. I am particularly interested in careers in data analytics and fixed income research, where I can apply quantitative skills to support investment decisions. My goal is to begin my career as a financial/data analyst in the Boston area and eventually transition into asset management with a focus on fixed income research.
