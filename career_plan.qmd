## Career Plan

As students preparing to enter the analytics and data science job market, we want to align our coursework with employer demands.

### Yibei's Plan
I am particularly interested in pursuing a career in data analytics or fixed-income research. Through this project, I’ve improved my ability to use data sources, citation management, and Quarto — skills highly valued by employers.

> Example goals:
> - Data Analyst Internship Opportunities Spring 2026
> - Learn Python, SQL, R, and Excel Modeling
> - Understand Industry Trends in AI/ML Applications
