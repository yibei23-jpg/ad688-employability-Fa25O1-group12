## Introduction

Our research project focuses on **Business Analytics, Data Science, and Machine Learning (ML)** job market trends in 2024. We aim to understand:

- What skills are in high demand for analytics/ML roles
- How job descriptions are evolving post-ChatGPT
- Which industries are hiring most aggressively and why
- What the career outlook is for analytics graduates

We explore these questions by analyzing job descriptions and articles from reputable sources such as:
- Google Scholar
- McKinsey & Company
- LinkedIn reports
- Government and university databases

This introduction sets the stage for deeper analysis in the following pages.
